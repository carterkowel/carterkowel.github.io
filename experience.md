**Projects**  
* Command Line Remote Debugger Script  	
![rs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carterkowel/carterkowel.github.io/master/assets/images/debugtoolgif.gif)  
	* Designed a python script that automates the connection process of using ARM and GDB to debug remote systems
	* Configured a launch.json file to intergrate the convieient VSCode debugger with the GDB 
	* Documented the script using diagrams, requirments.txt, and step-by-step instructions to streamline the setup process
	* Through continuous feedback and communication with my team, I incorporated thier desired features:
		* Implemented both argparse and ... to allow for the option to provide argumentrs or get prompted for them
		* The script seraches through your machines files to provide you with all valid options
		* Automatically selects an option when there is only one avaliable
		* Utalized a json file that stores the last ran paramaters and allows ussers to customize thier defualts
	
* Log Page Regression Testing Framework
	* Automated a testing framework for one of our products in C and C++

**Note: Respecting my employer and our NDA, I will refrain from describing certain details of my experience.**  
[Accelovant](https://www.accelovant.com/) is start-up company located in North Vancouver that is pushing the boundaries on innovative fiber-optic temperature solutions. My technical responsibilities included: 

**Design**  
* 4-Layer PCB Cost Reduction Redesign
	* Redesigned a 4-layer PCB in Altium, replacing an upstream transformer for a BUCK converter and a downstream digital isolator to reduce production cost by 20%
	* Routed sensitive SPI signals, utilizing multi-layer ground planes to protect the signals
	* Collaborated with colleagues to ensure accessible debugging pins and precise mechanical integration of components such as the grounding contact with the housing
* PCB Calibration Pogo Pin Jig
	* Designed a 3D printed jig in Solidworks that probes the DUT with pogo pins, introducing usability and repeatability to the calibration process
	* Developed a via stitched PCB in Altium with a coaxial cable to achieve optimal signal immunity
	* Manufactured a close-fitting carriage and selected self-aligning bushings for smooth functionality
	* Wrote detailed assembly and calibration procedures for use of the production team
* Statistical Process Control Python Code
	* Conducted statistical process control on electrical products by interpreting voltage readings
	* Designed a csv generation code in python which organizes data into graphical and analyzable form
* Force Analysis Production Jig
	* Designed an apparatus of 3D printed parts, a load cell, an Arduino, and a precision linear stage, that measures the reaction force from a given displacement
* 3D modeling products in SOLIDWORKS and Fushion360  
	* Used the CAM tool in Fushion360 for CNC milling 

**Documentation**   
* Made engineering drawings for clients and manufacturers  
* Followed Engineering Change Order protocol to release and revise designs into production  
* Wrote user manuals, safety documents, and procedures for client use  
* Designed step-by-step Manufacturing Assembly Instructions for various products  
* Maintained Bill Of Materials for several projects, tracking inventory and budgeting  


# UBC Solar Car Design Team  
Electrical and Mechanical Team Member, Sept 2019 – Mar 2021

[UBC Solar](https://ubcsolar.com/) is a student team focused on the design and manufacturing of solar-powered race cars. Their core values include sustainability, education, and proffesionalism. My technical responsibilities included: 

**Projects**  
* Car Cabling Schematic
	* Designed an organized wiring schematic of the car’s electrical systems using Altium
	* Purchased cabling based on gauge, shielding, length, and number of conductors
* Steering Wheel PCB
	* Designed a steering wheel board to efficiently house steering wheel controls, optimizing usability and reducing messy wiring
	* Integrated the circuit schematic and routing using Eagle, minimizing electrical noise using low pass filters
	* Placed surface mount components using a laser cut stencil and reflow oven, hand soldered through hole components
* 3D Modeling Mounts
	* Designed 3D mounts on Solidworks, optimizing structural integrity and weight
	* Selected components such as hinges, latches, and screws based on required specifications
	* Manufacturing a sheet metal mount using a waterjet cutter and a plastic mount using a 3D printer
