**Note: Respecting my employer and our NDA, I will refrain from describing certain details of my experience.**  
[Accelovant](https://www.accelovant.com/) is start-up company located in North Vancouver that is pushing the boundaries on innovative fiber-optic temperature solutions. My technical responsibilities included: 

**Design**  
* 4-Layer PCB Cost Reduction Redesign
	* Redesigned a 4-layer PCB in Altium, replacing an upstream transformer for a BUCK converter and a downstream digital isolator to reduce production cost by 20%
	* Routed sensitive SPI signals, utilizing multi-layer ground planes to protect the signals
	* Collaborated with colleagues to ensure accessible debugging pins and precise mechanical integration of components such as the grounding contact with the housing
* PCB Calibration Pogo Pin Jig
	* Designed a 3D printed jig in Solidworks that probes the DUT with pogo pins, introducing usability and repeatability to the calibration process
	* Developed a via stitched PCB in Altium with a coaxial cable to achieve optimal signal immunity
	* Manufactured a close-fitting carriage and selected self-aligning bushings for smooth functionality
	* Wrote detailed assembly and calibration procedures for use of the production team
* Statistical Process Control Python Code
	* Conducted statistical process control on electrical products by interpreting voltage readings
	* Designed a csv generation code in python which organizes data into graphical and analyzable form
* Force Analysis Production Jig
	* Designed an apparatus of 3D printed parts, a load cell, an Arduino, and a precision linear stage, that measures the reaction force from a given displacement
* 3D modeling products in SOLIDWORKS and Fushion360  
	* Used the CAM tool in Fushion360 for CNC milling 

**Documentation**   
* Made engineering drawings for clients and manufacturers  
* Followed Engineering Change Order protocol to release and revise designs into production  
* Wrote user manuals, safety documents, and procedures for client use  
* Designed step-by-step Manufacturing Assembly Instructions for various products  
* Maintained Bill Of Materials for several projects, tracking inventory and budgeting
