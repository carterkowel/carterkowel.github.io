# Mars Rover Robot Competition  
Electrical Lead, May 2021 – Aug 2021  
![rs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carterkowel/carterkowel.github.io/master/assets/images/robot1.PNG)  
* Designed an autonomous robot that collected and delivered cans using line following to traverse a course and servos to collect and deliver cans  
* Implemented an organized routing system with capacitors and shielding to reduce noise  
* Integrated and soldered h-bridges, sensor circuits, and servo actuator circuits  

# UBC Parking Machine Learning Competition  
UBC ENPH 353, Sept 2021 – Dec 2021  
![rs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carterkowel/carterkowel.github.io/master/assets/images/353im8.PNG)    
* Developed an autonomous controller for a ROS simulated robot capable of traversing a parking lot, obeying traffic laws, and processing a camera feed to identify license plates
* Identified license plates by implementing data processing techniques on the camera feed to isolate the plates, which were then inputted into a trained neural network

# IoT ESP32 Oven Preheater
Personal Project, Nov 2021 – Current
* Implemented an ngrok server for an esp32 driven servo which reliability preheats an oven remotely
