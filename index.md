# Education (What Is Engineering Physics?)  
In short, it is a fully accredited engineering program that is a combination of the real-world applications of engineering with the analytical rigor of physics and math.
Engineering physics students enroll in ELEC, CPEN, MECH, MATH, and PHYS classes and gain the fundamentals to take on multidisciplinary problem solving.
