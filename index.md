# Education (What Is Engineering Physics?)  
In short, it is a fully accredited engineering program that is a combination of the real-world applications of engineering with the analytical rigor of physics and math.
Engineering physics students enroll in ELEC, CPEN, MECH, MATH, and PHYS classes and gain the fundamentals to take on multidisciplinary problem solving.

# Technical Experience  
Through my journey as an engineering student, I have engaged in design teams, school projects, and 3 coop terms. These opportunities have not only been great for learning but have strengthened my passion for engineering. Applying concepts towards meaningful real-world problems is why I am interested in this discipline. I strive towards developing my abilities to increase my impact on the world around me.

# Personal Projects  
I have found that projects are a fun way to reinforce my learning by applying theory and knowledge towards real solutions. In addition, I enjoy being able to build a solution to a problem from the ground up, fully understanding the responsibilities and intricacies of every component.

# Leadership
My commitments to TAing and tutoring have helped me reflect and build upon my ability to be a leader to those around me. My experience on teams in engineering and non-engineering settings have taught me the value of leadership and I strive to actively focus on building and maintaining this skill.
