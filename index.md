# Welcome  

![rs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carterkowel/carterkowel.github.io/master/assets/images/profilepic2.PNG)  

My name is Carter Kowel and I am a fourth year engineering physics student and am looking for an 4 month coop position from May 2023 to August 2023.


# Education (What Is Engineering Physics?)  
In short, it is a fully accredited engineering program that is a combination of the real-world applications of engineering with the analytical rigor of physics and math.
Engineering physics students enroll in ELEC, CPEN, MECH, MATH, and PHYS classes and gain the fundamentals to take on multidisciplinary problem solving.

# Technical Experience  
Through my journey as an engineering student I have engaged in design teams, school projects, and a 4-month coop term. These opportunities have strengthened not only my learning, but my passion for engineering. Applying concepts towards meaningful real-world problems is why I am interested in this discipline. I strive towards developing my abilities in order to increase my impact on the world around me.

# Personal Projects  
I have found that projects are a great way to reinforce my learning by applying theory and knowledge towards real solutions. In addition, I enjoy identifying certain nuisances in my day to day life and attempting to solve them.
